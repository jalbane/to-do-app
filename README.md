List of the tasks that I thought consumed the most amount, to least amount of time below:

    - I spent most of my time fixing bigs and thinking of a good solution for nesting components/state management. I encountered a lot of bugs when trying to edit or delete to-do tasks that were returned from filtering the to-dos via the search bar.

    - Styling the to-do list page. It took a fair bit of time to get the layout the way I wanted. I'd never used a style library like styled-components before, but it was pretty easy to grasp and start using.

    - Styling the login page. I learned a lot of CSS pseudo-classes that I found helpful to meet the input validation and error messaging requirements. Getting the icons to neatly display inside the input fields was also quite tricky.

    - Adding the local storage functionality.
        
I think I spent about 6-8 hours on completing all of the login page requirements.
Finishing the to-do list page and removing every bug I found took somewhere around 16-20 hours.
